Query 2 - List StateName, vendor Name, vendor ZipCode, and FirstZipCode and LastZipCode, in that order. Apply an appropriate joining 
condition to retrieve matching information. Sort the results on StateName first and then or vendor Name.

Query 6 - Modify your Query 2 to use the BETWEEN … AND … operator to specify the joining condition, instead of an equality condition 
based on state abbreviation. All other requirements remain the same.
